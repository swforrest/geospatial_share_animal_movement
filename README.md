# Geospatial Share animal movement workshop

Resources for the Geospatial Share animal movement workshop in May 2024.

The coded example works through an individual-level step selection analysis of kākā that were GPS-tracked at Orokonui Ecosanctuary in Dunedin, Aotearoa (New Zealand).

Home range analyses that use the same GPS tracking data (from this paper: https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/csp2.13119) can be found in this repo: https://github.com/swforrest/Kaka_HR_DynamicSpaceUse.
